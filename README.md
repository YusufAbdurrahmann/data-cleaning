<h1>ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning â€“ Learning Notes (By Yusuf Abdurrahman)</h1>
<p><em>"Clean data is the foundation of trustworthy insights."</em></p>

<h2>ðŸ“˜ What I Learned in Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>In this project, I explored several essential techniques to prepare and clean raw data for analysis:</p>

<h3>1. Handling Missing Values</h3>
<p>Missing values are a common problem in datasets. Itâ€™s important to identify and handle them appropriately, either by removing or replacing them.</p>
<strong>Why it matters:</strong>
<p>Missing data can skew results or lead to incorrect conclusions, so addressing it is crucial for accurate analysis.</p>

<h3>2. Renaming Columns</h3>
<p>Sometimes, column names are unclear or have typos. Renaming columns improves clarity and makes the dataset more readable.</p>
<strong>Why it matters:</strong>
<p>Clear and descriptive column names improve understanding and help with data manipulation.</p>

<h3>3. Filling Missing Values (Imputation)</h3>
<p>Instead of removing rows with missing values, we can fill them using different methods like mean, median, or a predefined value.</p>
<strong>Why it matters:</strong>
<p>Imputing missing values helps preserve data and prevents loss of valuable information, especially in large datasets.</p>
