<h2>ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning â€“ Learning Notes
"Clean data is the foundation of trustworthy insights."</h2>

ðŸ“˜ What I Learned in Data Cleaning
Hereâ€™s a summary of the key concepts Iâ€™ve learned while exploring the data cleaning process:

1. Handling Missing Values
One of the most common issues in real-world datasets is missing values. Itâ€™s important to identify them and decide the best way to handle them, whether by removing or replacing them.

2. Renaming Columns
Clear and consistent column names help make the data easier to understand and work with. Renaming columns also improves readability and supports better collaboration.

3. Filling Missing Values (Imputation)
Instead of removing rows with missing values, we can fill them using various imputation methods such as mean, median, or a predefined value. This helps preserve data while maintaining accuracy.

4. Handling Outliers
Outliers are extreme values that can skew analysis or machine learning models. Detecting and addressing them ensures that insights drawn from the data are reliable.
